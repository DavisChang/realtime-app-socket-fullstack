## Redis

is ideal for scenarios that require simple, efficient, and low-latency real-time communication, especially when there is no need to ensure message reliability and order. It can be quickly deployed and operated, making it suitable for small-scale or early-stage real-time applications.

## Message Queue

is more suitable for large-scale applications that require high reliability, guaranteed message order, and persistence. When your application needs to handle large volumes of real-time data and requires stronger fault tolerance, an MQ is a better choice.
